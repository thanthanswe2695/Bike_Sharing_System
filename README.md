Bike_Sharing_System

1. Collected data from Capital bike share system in Washington,DC
2. Data was detected outliers, missing values and formatting the data by using descriptive analysis and
  prepared for the data before applying the machine learning model.
3. Data was divided into training data (80%) and testing data(20%) via train-test split method before going
   through machine learning models.
4. I have continuous variable in target variable.So,it is a regression problem and choose 7 different regression models.
5. Finally, I selected the best model to predict the future data,saved the model as a pickle file and deployed with Django        framework on Heroku platform.Here is the application link https://mybikesystemapp.herokuapp.com .
